    Fact: the best salsa is made with fresh tomatoes. 
    Okay, that’s just my opinion, but in the past I thought I could go the route of using all canned tomatoes, 
    but using fresh tomatoes makes a world of difference! Fresh tomatoes make the best salsa, 
    especially when you use nicely ripened in season tomatoes. This is hands down my favorite salsa recipe,
    and I don’t know that I’ll ever need another one. It just has the perfect ratio and blend of everything.
    It’s not too oniony or garlicy, nor too spicy for my kids, 
    it doesn’t tasting like it came from a can and it has the perfect brightness with the fresh lime. 
    Then it has a classic Mexican flavor with the cilantro and hint of chili powder and cumin.
