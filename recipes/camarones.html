    Camarones al mojo de ajo! Easy! Delicious! Well, as long as you love shrimp, garlic, 
    lemon and butter! I have mentioned this several times when posting shrimp recipes, 
    but I am so happy my better half loves shrimp these days. There was a time when he 
    would not even considered tasting it. On Friday’s I prepare a dish to pass for a community 
    lunch that I go to. So most Friday’s I am pretty tired and don’t have much energy to 
    get creative for dinner. This is why, many times, I will opt for seafood recipes to prepare on Friday’s. 
    Camarones al mojo de ajo are also called camarones al ajillo. Many times served over pasta, 
    but we enjoyed it with crusty bread that was toasted.
